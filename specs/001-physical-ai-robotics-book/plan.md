# Implementation Plan: Educational Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Branch**: `001-physical-ai-robotics-book` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

To create an educational book on the practical application of AI in physical robotics, emphasizing embodied intelligence through simulation and deployment, targeting university students and early-career engineers. The book will have a high-level architecture using Docusaurus (sidebar + folder structure), a detailed section outline across 4 modules, a content creation workflow integrating SpeckitPlus and Cloud Code, and a quality validation pipeline including reproducibility checks, dead-link scanning, and simulation testing.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, JavaScript/TypeScript for Docusaurus
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, ROS 2 Iron, Gazebo Harmonic, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, OpenAI GPT-4o API, Ollama llama3:8b
**Storage**: Filesystem (Markdown, Docusaurus assets)
**Testing**: GitHub Actions, AWS g5.4xlarge, Lychee (or similar)
**Target Platform**: Web (GitHub Pages), Ubuntu 22.04 + RTX 4080, Jetson Orin Nano 8GB + RealSense D435i
**Project Type**: Documentation/Book
**Performance Goals**: N/A (Focus on reproducibility and clarity)
**Constraints**: Word count (10,000-20,000), Markdown format, Inline links to sources, Sources < 5 years old.
**Scale/Scope**: 4 modules, 5+ reproducible code/sim setups per module.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Accuracy through verification**: PASSED. The plan incorporates verification against established robotics frameworks and tools (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac), aligning with the constitution's principle of accuracy through verification.
- **II. Clarity for student audience**: PASSED. The plan explicitly targets university students or early-career engineers with introductory AI knowledge, ensuring content clarity for the intended audience.
- **III. Reproducibility**: PASSED. The plan emphasizes that all code examples, simulations, and hardware setups must be executable and traceable, directly addressing the reproducibility principle.
- **IV. Rigor**: PASSED. The plan prioritizes official documentation, tutorials, and industry-standard practices for research and content validation.
