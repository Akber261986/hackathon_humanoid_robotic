# Welcome

Welcome to the educational book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This book is designed to guide university students and early-career engineers through the practical application of AI in physical robotics, with a strong emphasis on embodied intelligence through simulation and real-world deployment.

## What You Will Learn

Throughout this book, you will gain hands-on experience and theoretical understanding in:

*   **ROS 2:** The Robot Operating System for building robust robotic applications.
*   **Humanoid Simulation:** Setting up and interacting with humanoid robots in simulation environments like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
*   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models:** Integrating modern AI models (like LLMs and Vision Transformers) to enable advanced robot perception, reasoning, and action capabilities.
*   **Hardware Deployment:** Understanding the considerations for deploying AI models onto physical humanoid robot platforms, such as the Jetson Orin Nano.

We aim to provide a comprehensive and reproducible learning experience, with lab exercises and code examples that you can run and verify yourself.

Let's embark on this exciting journey into the world of physical AI and humanoid robotics!
