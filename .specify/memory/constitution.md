# Educational book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy through verification
Verification against established robotics frameworks and tools (e.g., ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac)

### II. Clarity for student audience
Computer science or engineering background, assuming introductory AI knowledge

### III. Reproducibility
All code examples, simulations, and hardware setups must be executable and traceable

### IV. Rigor
Prefer official documentation, tutorials, and industry-standard practices

## Key Standards

All technical claims must be traceable to sources (e.g., official ROS docs, NVIDIA developer resources)
Citation format: Markdown links or inline references to URLs/docs
Source types: minimum 50% official documentation and open-source repositories
Plagiarism check: 0% tolerance; all content must be original synthesis
Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-10 for accessibility

## Constraints

Word count: Flexible per chapter, total book 10,000-20,000 words
Minimum 10 sources per module

## Governance

TODO(GOVERNANCE_RULES): The governance rules need to be defined. This should include amendment procedures, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.
